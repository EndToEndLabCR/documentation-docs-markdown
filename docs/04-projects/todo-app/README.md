# TODO App Project Idea

## Project Overview

The TODO App is a web-based application designed to help users organize their tasks and projects. The app will have the following core features:

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- **Project Management**: Users can create, update, and delete projects.
- **Task Management**: Users can add tasks to projects, update their status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), set deadlines, and delete tasks.
- **Dashboard**: Users will have an overview of their tasks and their statuses (e.g., a kanban board or a task summary).
- **Notifications**: Users will receive notifications for tasks nearing deadlines or overdue.
- **Responsive Design**: The app will be fully responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Calendar View**: Implement a calendar view for tasks and deadlines.
- **Third-Party Integration**: Add integration with third-party tools (e.g., Google Calendar).
