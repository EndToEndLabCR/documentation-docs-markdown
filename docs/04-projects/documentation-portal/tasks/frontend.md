## Frontend Development Best Practices

When developing the documentation portal, follow these best practices:

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Component Reusability**: Create reusable components for common patterns
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all components are keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly
- **Performance**: Optimize images, lazy load components, minimize bundle size
- **SEO**: Use semantic HTML and proper meta tags
- **Responsive Design**: Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
- **Documentation**: Document custom components and configurations
- **Version Control**: Commit regularly with clear commit messages
- **Code Quality**: Follow ESLint rules and use Prettier for formatting
- **Testing**: Write tests for custom components and critical functionality

---

**Note:** This documentation portal leverages Docusaurus, which provides many features out of the box. Focus on customization and enhancement rather than building from scratch.
