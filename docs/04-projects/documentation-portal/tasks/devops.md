## DevOps Best Practices

When setting up infrastructure and deployment, follow these best practices:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define infrastructure in code for reproducibility
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks (builds, tests, deployments)
- **Version Control**: Keep all configuration in version control
- **Security First**: Apply security best practices from the start
- **Monitoring**: Monitor performance, uptime, and errors continuously
- **Documentation**: Document all processes and procedures
- **Backup**: Implement regular backups and test recovery
- **Testing**: Test deployments in staging before production
- **Rollback**: Have a rollback strategy for failed deployments
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast load times and responsiveness
- **Cost Optimization**: Use free or low-cost services where appropriate
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and increased traffic

---

## GitHub Pages Deployment Notes

GitHub Pages provides several advantages for documentation hosting:

- **Free hosting** for public repositories
- **Built-in CDN** for fast global delivery
- **Automatic HTTPS** with SSL certificates
- **Custom domain support**
- **High availability** and reliability
- **GitHub Actions integration** for CI/CD
- **Version control** through Git

### Limitations to Consider

- Static site only (no server-side code)
- 1GB repository size limit
- 100GB monthly bandwidth soft limit
- Build time limits in GitHub Actions

---

## Alternative Hosting Options

If GitHub Pages doesn't meet requirements, consider:

- **Netlify**: Free tier, deploy previews, serverless functions
- **Vercel**: Free tier, excellent performance, edge functions
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Free tier, global CDN, Workers integration
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Scalable, pay-as-you-go pricing
- **Self-hosted**: Full control, requires maintenance

---

**Note:** Most DevOps tasks can leverage free or low-cost services, making the documentation portal cost-effective to operate.
