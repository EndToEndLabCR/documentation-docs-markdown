# Getting Started with Docker

This file provides an introduction to Docker and how to get started with it.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

## Key Concepts

- **Containers**: Lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed to run an application
- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers
- **Dockerfile**: Text file containing instructions to build a Docker image
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Pull an image
docker pull nginx

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id
```

## Getting Started

1. Install Docker on your system
2. Verify installation: `docker --version`
3. Run your first container: `docker run hello-world`
4. Explore Docker Hub for available images
