# Testing in Python

This file covers testing strategies, frameworks, and best practices for Python applications.

## Testing Frameworks

### pytest (Recommended)
- Most popular Python testing framework
- Simple syntax and powerful features
- Extensive plugin ecosystem
- Great assertion introspection

### unittest (Built-in)
- Part of Python standard library
- Class-based test structure
- Good for traditional unit testing

### doctest
- Tests embedded in docstrings
- Great for simple examples
- Documentation and testing combined

## pytest Examples

```python
# test_math.py
def test_addition():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4

def test_division():
    assert 10 / 2 == 5

# Using fixtures
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return {"name": "John", "age": 30}

def test_sample_data(sample_data):
    assert sample_data["name"] == "John"
```

## Testing Types

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/methods
- Fast execution
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Database connections
- API endpoints

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete workflows
- User scenarios
- Browser automation (Selenium)

## Best Practices

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external services
- Maintain test independence
- Use fixtures for setup/teardown
- Achieve good test coverage

## Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Install coverage
pip install coverage

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run -m pytest

# Generate report
coverage report
coverage html
```

## Continuous Integration

Integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines for automated quality assurance.
