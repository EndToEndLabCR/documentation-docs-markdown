# Flask vs FastAPI Comparison

This file compares Flask and FastAPI frameworks to help you choose the right tool for your project.

## Overview

Both Flask and FastAPI are popular Python web frameworks, each with its own strengths and use cases.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Flask | FastAPI |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Performance | Moderate | High |
| Learning Curve | Easy | Moderate |
| Type Hints | Optional | Built-in |
| API Documentation | Manual | Automatic |
| Async Support | Limited | Native |
| Ecosystem | Mature | Growing |

## Flask Strengths

- **Mature ecosystem**: Large community and extensive plugins
- **Flexibility**: Minimal and unopinionated
- **Learning curve**: Easy to get started
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and well-established
- **Deployment**: Many hosting options

## FastAPI Strengths

- **Performance**: Significantly faster
- **Modern Python**: Leverages type hints and async/await
- **Automatic docs**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration
- **Data validation**: Built-in with Pydantic
- **Editor support**: Better IDE autocompletion

## When to Choose Flask

- Building traditional web applications
- Need maximum flexibility
- Working with legacy code
- Team familiar with Flask
- Simple CRUD applications

## When to Choose FastAPI

- Building APIs (especially REST/GraphQL)
- Performance is critical
- Modern Python development
- Automatic documentation needed
- Real-time applications with WebSockets

## Migration Considerations

- FastAPI can coexist with Flask applications
- Gradual migration strategies available
- Consider team expertise and project requirements
