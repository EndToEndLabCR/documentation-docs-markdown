## üßë‚Äçüíª General Rules

1. **Respect Existing Style:**  
   Follow the formatting and style already used in the repository for documentation, folder structure, and code snippets.

2. **Clear Naming:**

   - Use lower-case and hyphens (`-`) for file and folder names.
   - File names should reflect their content (e.g., `github-actions.md`, `best-practices.md`).

3. **Documentation Standards:**

   - Use Markdown for documentation files.
   - Start each file with a clear heading and (if needed) a brief summary.
   - Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize sections.
   - Prefer bullet points, tables, and code blocks for clarity.
   - Link to external references and related documentation when possible.

4. **Code Snippets:**

   - Ensure code examples are correct and tested (if applicable).
   - Use appropriate syntax highlighting in code blocks (e.g., `python,`bash).
   - Comment code samples to explain non-obvious steps.

5. **Best Practices:**

   - Share proven, recommended ways of doing things.
   - Avoid duplicating content‚Äîlink to existing resources when relevant.
   - Update or deprecate outdated information.

6. **Commit Messages:**

   - Follow [Conventional Commits](../github/commits-guide.md) (e.g., `docs: update python setup guide`, `chore: fix typos`).
   - Write clear, concise messages describing the change.

7. **Review and Approval:**
   - Open a pull request for all changes.
   - Be open to feedback and willing to revise your contribution for clarity or consistency.
