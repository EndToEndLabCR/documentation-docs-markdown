# State Management in React

This file covers different approaches to managing state in React applications.

## Local State (useState)

For simple, component-specific state:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Context API

For sharing state across components:

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react';

const AuthContext = createContext();

const authReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOGIN':
      return { ...state, user: action.payload, isAuthenticated: true };
    case 'LOGOUT':
      return { ...state, user: null, isAuthenticated: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(authReducer, {
    user: null,
    isAuthenticated: false
  });

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
```

## Redux Toolkit (Complex State)

For large applications with complex state:

```jsx
import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    }
  }
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterSlice.reducer
  }
});
```

## State Management Guidelines

- Start with local state
- Use Context for medium complexity
- Consider Redux for complex applications
- Keep state as flat as possible
- Normalize complex data structures
- Use selectors to compute derived state
