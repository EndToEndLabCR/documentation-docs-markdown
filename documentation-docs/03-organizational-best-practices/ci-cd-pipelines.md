# CI/CD Pipelines

This file covers best practices for implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines.

## CI/CD Overview

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Automated testing on code changes
- Code quality checks
- Build verification
- Merge conflict prevention

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Automated deployment to staging/production
- Environment management
- Rollback capabilities
- Release automation

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Source Control Integration
```yaml
# Trigger on specific events
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

### 2. Build Stage
```yaml
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
```

### 3. Test Stage
```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build
  steps:
    - name: Run unit tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Run integration tests
      run: npm run test:integration
    - name: Generate coverage report
      run: npm run test:coverage
```

### 4. Quality Checks
```yaml
quality:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Lint code
      run: npm run lint
    - name: Check formatting
      run: npm run format:check
    - name: Security scan
      run: npm audit
    - name: SonarQube analysis
      uses: sonarqube-quality-gate-action@master
```

### 5. Deployment Stage
```yaml
deploy:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [test, quality]
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to staging
      run: |
        # Deployment script
        echo "Deploying to staging..."
    - name: Run smoke tests
      run: npm run test:smoke
    - name: Deploy to production
      if: success()
      run: |
        # Production deployment
        echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## Best Practices

### Pipeline Design
- Keep pipelines fast and efficient
- Use parallel execution where possible
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful stage names
- Document pipeline configuration

### Environment Management
```yaml
environments:
  staging:
    url: https://staging.example.com
    protection_rules:
      required_reviewers: 1
  production:
    url: https://example.com
    protection_rules:
      required_reviewers: 2
      wait_timer: 30
```

### Secret Management
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy with secrets
    env:
      DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    run: deploy.sh
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests (fast, isolated)
- Integration tests (component interactions)
- End-to-end tests (full user workflows)
- Performance tests (load/stress testing)
- Security tests (vulnerability scanning)

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Two identical production environments
- Switch traffic between environments
- Zero downtime deployments
- Easy rollback

### Rolling Deployment
- Gradual replacement of instances
- Maintains service availability
- Slower rollback process

### Canary Deployment
- Deploy to subset of users
- Monitor metrics and errors
- Gradual traffic increase
- Risk mitigation

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Pipeline Monitoring
- Build success/failure rates
- Test coverage trends
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to recovery

### Application Monitoring
- Health checks
- Performance metrics
- Error rates
- User experience metrics

### Alerting Rules
- Failed deployments
- Test failures
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities
